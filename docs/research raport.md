## Appoach

At a start of a project is is important to first gather information. This can be related to technical or general knowlage about the project or relavant theoreies.

### Objective

After researching the required theory the object is to make a programmable 6 axis robot arm. This needs to have a valid communication protocal and the ability to have different grippers. This is to increase the understanding about robotics and 6 axis robot programming.

The goal is to make a six axis robot arm from scratch, with the use of a microcontroller that can communicate with a pc or PLC to be programmable.
With the purpuse of learning how to code a microcontroller on the lower level. And to get a better understanding of how devices communicate. Lastly
How to accrutely program robot to perform tasks.

And having documentation so that anyone can recreate this project.

The reasons for trying to make this robot are:

- Increase the knowlegde about communication protocols: By researching and implemting a communication protocol the proficitie in this will increase.
- Increase of knowledge in robotics:
