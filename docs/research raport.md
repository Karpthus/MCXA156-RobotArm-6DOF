# 6DOF robot arm

## The Goal

The goal is to make a six axis robot arm from scratch, with the use of a microcontroller that can communicate with a pc or PLC to be programmable.
With the purpuse of learning how to code a microcontroller on the lower level. And to get a better understanding of how devices communicate. Lastly
How to accrutely program robot to perform tasks.

And having documentation so that anyone can recreate this project.

## Requirements
