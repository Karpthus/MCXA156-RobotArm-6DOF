# The goal of this project

The goal is to make a six axis robot arm from scratch, with the use of a microcontroller that can communicate with a pc or PLC to be programmable. 
With the purpuse of learning how to code a microcontroller on the lower level. And to get a better understanding of how devices communicate. Lastly 
How to accrutely program robot to perform tasks. 

And having documentation so that anyone can recreate this project.
